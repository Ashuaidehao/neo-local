## What?

Developing smart contracts for the NEO blockchain requires a **local network** to be running, that acts as a private NEO blockchain running locally on your machine. 

This project quickly sets this up for you without any prior knowledge needed, along with a number of other utility [services](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/wiki#services) that help with development.

This project works on MacOS, Linux and Windows machines üëç
